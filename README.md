## Predicting gene stratified CH 

The scripts are arranged in two parts:

### 1) Data processing scripts and bash files

To run these, access to the UK Biobank is required. 

Run scripts from 1 to 7 to produce a dataset to be used to train the random forest model. 


### 2) Machine learning script

In here is the script used to train the gene-stratified random forest model for ASXL1. Can be adjusted for each gene.
